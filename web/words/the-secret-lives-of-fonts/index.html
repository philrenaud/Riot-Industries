					<p><em>Note: This was originally published on March 12, 2006 - I've decided to include it here so it has a permanent home.</em></p>
					<p>I’m nearing the end of my sixth semester of university, and things are going pretty well: I’m clearing a decent grade point average, enjoying my major, and just having wrapped up my semester’s “essay alley”, wherein all my courses require a term paper or two, and getting my results back telling me that I’m doing much better than usual.</p>
					<p>At first, I’m just relieved to be doing so well. Still, ever the skeptic, I start to wonder: what exactly am I doing differently now to be getting all these A-range paper grades all of the sudden?</p>
					<p>I haven’t drastically changed the amount of effort I’m putting into my writing. I’m probably even spending less time with them now than I did earlier in my studies, and while I guess you could argue that I’m probably just being a great example of practice making perfect, I’ve got my doubts; I even used to take courses concentrating on writing better essays, and in the time surrounding that, my grades were pretty low.</p>
					<p>Then it hits me: the only thing I’ve really changed since I’ve been getting these grades is…</p>
					<p><strong>my essay font</strong>.</p>
					<p>Long story short, this throws me into something of a panic: I keep all my essays’ final copies in storage, so I go through every scholarly paper I’ve written for the past few years in hopes of garnering some sort of makeshift <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism">empirical</a> results with regards to my essay styles. Here’s what I’m working with:</p>
					<p><strong>Total Number of Essays Written</strong>: 52.</p>
					<p><strong>Fonts Used</strong>: <a title="Georgia" href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FID=4&amp;FNAME=Georgia">Georgia</a>, <a title="Trebuchet MS" href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FID=2&amp;FNAME=Trebuchet%20MS">Trebuchet MS</a>, <a title="Times New Roman" href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FID=9&amp;FNAME=Times%20New%20Roman">Times New Roman</a>.</p>
					<p>Let me explain what I found; I think the results might be a little bit surprising.</p>
					<p><strong>Times New Roman</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Total <em>Times New Roman</em> styled essays</strong>: 11</p>
					<p><strong>Average Grade</strong>: A-</p>
					<p>Everybody starts out using Times New Roman, I think. It’s the default in most text editors, and the natural tendency of first-year college students being lazy, it’s unlikely too many of them bothered messing around with the fonts until at least later in their studies. I was in the same boat. Anyway, the A- average is pretty close to where my GPA stands, and assuming that the professor marking the papers generally sees a few hundred in <em>Times</em> font every semester, I imagine he/she really just marked the paper on the basis of its integrity.</p>
					<p>However, I don’t think I can say the same about the next two fonts…</p>
					<p><strong>Trebuchet MS</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Total <em>Trebuchet MS</em> styled essays</strong>: 18</p>
					<p><strong>Average Grade</strong>: B-</p>
					<p>Ouch! Nobody likes to see a B- on papers that they put serious effort into. Unfortunately, these guys made up more than a third of my total essay output.</p>
					<p>So what gives? Was I just neglecting my papers around this time? Personal crises bogging me down? Partying a  little too hard?</p>
					<p>Actually, none of the above. I wrote most of these in second-third year, where I had a good bit more free time to study than usual, and as it turns out, I got some of my best overall marks. I checked my exam/non-essay grades from around that time, and they were through the roof! “A”-range grades on pretty much <em>everything that didn’t give me the option of styling my font</em>.</p>
					<p>Well, before I start chanting “Academic Objectivity is a myth”, there’s still one more font to investigate</p>
					<p><strong>Georgia</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Total <em>Georgia</em> styled essays</strong>: 23</p>
					<p><strong>Average Grade</strong>: A</p>
					<p>Well, would you believe it? My essays written in Georgia did the best overall. This got me thinking as to why that might be: <em>maybe fonts speak a lot louder than we think they do</em>. Especially to a professor who has to wade through a collection of them; <em>Times</em> seems to be the norm, so it really doesn’t set off any subconcious triggers. <em>Georgia</em> is enough like <em>Times</em> to retain its academic feel, and is different enough to be something of a relief for the grader. <em>Trebuchet</em> seems to set off a negative trigger, maybe just based on the fact that it’s not as easy to read in print, maybe on the fact that it looks like something off a blog rather than an academic journal. Who knows.</p>
					<p><strong>So, what are you trying to say?</strong></p>
					<p>I want to say that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif">serifs</a> appeal to academics more than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif">sans-serifs</a> do. I even <a title="Fifteen Blatantly Untested Hypotheses" href="http://philrenaud.com/124">briefly hypothesized</a> that potential students would be innately drawn towards a the site of <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">a college with a serif font</a> more than <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/about/">one with a sans-serif</a>.</p>
					<p>I didn’t go into this hoping to try and make any claims against academic integrity here; I can’t imagine this is something that a professor would do knowingly.</p>
					<p>What I’m not opposed to saying, however, is that the style used in an essay <em>certainly seems to influence grading tendencies</em>, even if that is at an unconcious level. I think that it’s possible that a person sees a Serif font and thinks “proper, academic”, and sees a Sans font and thinks “focus is on the style, not the substance; must lack integrity”. Maybe.</p>
					<p>But, it’s hard to deny this, evidenced over 52 papers. Within each of the three fonts I used, there wasn’t terribly much variance, either. It’s not like these were just written for one subject, either: a wide range of disciplines were included, from Philosophy to Economics to Marketting to Political Science to Computer Science, even having paper on <a title="Neural Networks" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Networks">Computational Neuromodelling</a> thrown in there.</p>
					<p>So, be mindful of your target audience when you’re marking up a document, whether it’s a university essay or a commercial website. You never know just how loudly a font speaks.</p>
